## Hello there!

I'm Kate, your resident ADHD artist. I've left social media for the most part, but it's kind of nice to have a place to put down my thoughts without worrying about not having ownership of my content.

If my work has helped you in some way feel free to send me a coffee ;\)

I hope you enjoy reading through my progress on digital painting, reading, gaming and guides. Thanks for visiting!

No way I could just pick one... so gona have to do a long answer!

My recent favorites:

* [Len's Island](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1335830/Lens_Island/)

    Having fun with this new isometric Valheim-esque game... the concept ain't super original but the game brings its own charm!

* [Dead Cells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/)
    
    Favorite game I suck at. Fun roguelike though


* [One Deck Dungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/770100/One_Deck_Dungeon/)

   Found the physical game while visiting frens in Canada! Steam version is lit as well.

My consistent favorites:

* [Core Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper)

    My favorite survivalcraft sandbox. The devs really removed every terrible mechanic I hate about every other survivalcraft or farming game. Absoluted GOATED

* [Divinity Original Sin II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/)

    Favorite RPG story, if this had Baulder's Gate 3 tech I will go crazy 

* [Nier:Automata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/) (haven't played this in a while)

    My favorite story game, mainly because of the extential crisis I get even if I'm not actively playing it. Its world building is off the charts, and the OSTs are beyond amazing.
