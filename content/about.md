## Hello there!

I'm Kate, your resident ADHD artist. My blog was initially created to share cool stuff with my friends, and has now evolved to include posts and guides for communities I like.

I hope you enjoy reading through my progress on digital painting, reading, gaming and guides. If you like my work, definitely let me know!
