## Hello there!

I'm Kate, your resident ADHD artist. I've left social media for the most part, but it's kind of nice to have a place to put down my thoughts without worrying about not having ownership of my content.

If you would like some art from me, [message me on ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aizera) for commissions (and be sure to read the [ToS](https://aizera.art/#commissions) on my website!!)

I hope you enjoy reading through my progress on digital painting, reading, gaming and guides. Thanks for visiting!
