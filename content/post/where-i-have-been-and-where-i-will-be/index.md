Heya all. I am still here, still alive, and still going. For a while, I didn't have much to write, and that's okay. Working, and doing things tangentially related to work has gotten me into the groove. When I'm not working though, I do prefer to be away from that fast-paced productivity and efficiency driven mentality.

So lately, I've been trying to reach a state of mind where time passes in a slower, relaxed pace; my mind freeing itself from constant rush and anxiety.

### Slowing Down
Summer afternoons around my workplace does get quite hot. I've found a nearby park I could take refuge in between my part-time shifts. The trees make the place about 5-10 degrees cooler, and being out on a sunny day always makes me feel refreshed.

Some days, I'll get a chance to see fun people training their friendly dogs. Other days, no one will be around and I will be with nothing but my journal, listening to the sound of chirping birds and cars driving by. And when we don't have somewhere to be, or something to do, that's when our days slow down, and our minds begin to clear.

### Shifting Paradigms

For the past decade, I have filled most of my free time playing League of Legends; that is my way of coping with all the difficult things I have to go through in real life. But if our game of choice is a competitive one, our minds still don't get the luxury to be at ease. We remain in focus, trying to win and trying to prove we are better than others in some way, shape or form. The older I get, the harder it gets to justify playing competitive pvp games as a good use of my time. Although I haven't chosen to quit completely, it seems that I will be investing a lot less time in League or such similar games in the future.

What is most valuable to me now, going forward? The first thing is being able to spend time with my friends, catching up, and making sure each day don't pass by the way grains of sand pass by between our fingers. Be it drawing, journaling, enjoying single-player games, exercising with ring fit, or language studies, it is important that I am either spending my time honing my craft(s), or doing things that add value to my life. 

Well, that's it for now~ most of you who I know will be reading this do know where to find me, so you're always welcome to reach out ^-^ thank you and until next time!
