I finally got a 9-5 job.

Hey again my dudes, my current job consists of teaching a little bit of coding to Kindergarteners that are incoming first graders. I'm playing less league, and in general, I've just been more exhausted whenever I come home from work. My game review stuff will be on hold until further notice. Sorry!

Most of these 10 weeks just seems like a grind, just like the days where I spent being home, I've been doing the same things every day that I'm losing count of the days. I decided to start two different books without finishing either of them, one is a novel called "Neverwhere" by Neil Gaiman, and the other is a self-help book called "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. I'm enjoying reading both of those, bit by bit. I'll consider writing about Atomic Habits once I'm done reading.

Thanks folks, and I hope y'all are doing wonderful.
