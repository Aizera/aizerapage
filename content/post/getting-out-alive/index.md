### Intro 
This is that one catchy song I really like that I found from James Jani's youtube videos. Posting this bc I couldn't search this using partial lyrics and spent a long time looking for it. Suppose if you're here, your luck has been better than mine.

### Lyrics

Too many days is yet to come  
Too many times has come to pass  
Too many moments put aside  
Getting out alive, getting out alive  

Writing letters in the sand  
Lost to ocean's gentle hand  
Through the sunrise I will thrive  
Getting out alive, getting out alive  

When you find that open door  
You gotta let them love you more  
Tender hearts will always fight  
The darkness of the light  

When you find that open door  
You gotta let them love you more  
Tender hearts will always fight  
The darkness of the light (x4)
