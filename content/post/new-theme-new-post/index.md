Well, decided to try out a brand new theme I found on github named [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo). It looks quite nice actually. I haven't had much to write about all the time these days, but now with all the social media companies screwing over its users left and right, I suppose it's a great time now more than ever to have some content out there that is truly mine.

And if I do get a little less busy this year, perhaps you'll hear a little more from me. cheers~
